      <h2>Plans</h2>
      <p>
        As the Fremont Union High School District Student Board Representative, it is my job to ensure that of YOUR needs are met, concerns and issues are brought up, and I play my part in fostering an engaging working environment in which we can be successful. I have a couple of goals for the upcoming year in order to achieve the Intra-District’s and Board of Trustees’  goal of increasing communication and transparency between them and the student body, continue to receive student feedback, as well as raise awareness about the various concerns among students.

        <h4>Student Activities Committee</h4>
        <p>
As the Student Board Representative, I’m hoping to implement a committee that will be in charge of planning activities and events that will help foster student growth and opportunities for student leaders across the district to collaborate with one another. This committee will plan events that will cater towards student interests such as district-wide hackathons, business competitions, speaker events and more! Another major project the Committee will be working is the Leadership Summer Academy in which members of all the Leadership classes in the schools in this district will be encouraged to participate. If you have an idea for an event, feel free to reach out to a member of the Student Activities committee at your school or contact them by email! They're going to be hard at work to plan events for all of you.</p>

        <h4>Student Ambassador Program </h4>
        <p>
In order for the Board of Trustees to be able to hear more student concerns and issues, two students will be given the opportunity to serve as Student Ambassadors for their school to report update me, the Student Board Representative, where I will then directly relay the information over to the Board of Trustees. These two individuals will be selected through an application process and will be assigned with the duty of remaining in constant communication with me to the full extent of their term. These two Student Ambassadors from each school differ from the IDC Representatives as they provide a different opinion on issues regarding student life than those in ASB/Student council. More different perspectives means more information for the Board of Trustees to take into better assess how to meet the various needs of this diverse student body. </p>

        <h4> Increased Communication</h4>
        <p>
We as students need to be given the necessary outlets to be able to voice our opinions. So, in an effort to more adequately represent you, the student body, I’m going to be utilizing different platforms such as Infinite Campus and School Loop to allow for YOU to let me know what items of discussion you want me to bring to the Board of Trustees. In addition, there is a section on this website dedicated just to taking your feedback and opinions, so feel free to check it out at “Student’s Input.” I will be compilling all of the information I collect from the various platforms in my Student Representative Reports, so feel free to the check out the past Reports to gain new ideas for improvements within our district. More communication between me and each and every single one  of you, means more teamwork and we all know teamwork makes the dream work.

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        The Vintage Vitality system includes both a hardware and software componenet. The actual device itself is a smartband that goes around the wrist of the person being monitored. Meanwhile, the app allows others to keep track.

        <h4>Health</h4>
        <p>
          The built-in sensors on the smartband allow family members to keep track of their beloved's vital signs from anywhere around the world. The app displays real-time heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration.

        <h4>Location</h4>
        <p>
          In case the elderly user ever gets lost or wanders, the smartband has a built-in GPS tracker that allows family members to track down their beloved if anything goes wrong. They can stay connected 24/7.

        <h4>Pills</h4>
        <p>
          Many elderly people have an array of prescription medications that they are required to take. Our application reminds them at certain times to take medication, glowing different colors for different medicines.
